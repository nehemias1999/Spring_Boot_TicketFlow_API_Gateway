Service registry for the **TicketFlow** ticket reservation system. Acts as the central Eureka Server where all microservices register themselves and discover each other by name instead of hardcoded URLs.

## Overview

`discovery-service` is a standalone **Netflix Eureka Server**. It does not register itself in the registry and does not fetch the registry from any peer — it is the source of truth for service locations. Every other microservice in TicketFlow (config-server, api-gateway, event-service, ticket-service) registers with this server on startup and uses it to resolve the addresses of other services at runtime.

## Role in the Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     discovery-service                        │

  config-server    api-gateway    event-service
  (port 8088)      (port 8080)    (port 8081)
```

**Startup order** — the discovery-service must be the first service started, as all other services attempt to register with Eureka on boot.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `register-with-eureka` | `false` — the server does not register itself |
| `fetch-registry` | `false` — the server does not replicate from peers |

## Eureka Dashboard

Once the service is running, the Eureka web dashboard is available at:

```
http://localhost:8761
```

The dashboard shows:
- All registered service instances with their status (`UP` / `DOWN`)
- Instance metadata (IP, port, health-check URL)
- General server information (environment, uptime, renewal threshold)

---

## Configuration

Key properties from `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: discovery-service

server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false   # this node is the registry, not a client
    fetch-registry: false         # no peer replication in single-node setup
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, info, metrics
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```

---

## Running the Service

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.9+

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the service directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd discovery-service
   ```

2. **Run the service**:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Verify the dashboard is available at `http://localhost:8761`.

> **Start this service first.** All other TicketFlow microservices register with Eureka on startup. Starting them before the discovery-service will cause registration errors (they will retry, but it is cleaner to start in order).

---

## Running Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

The test profile uses a dedicated `src/test/resources/application.yml` that assigns a random port (`0`) and disables peer replication, so the context loads without requiring a real Eureka instance to be running.

## Health & Monitoring

Spring Boot Actuator exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /actuator/health` | Service health status and details |
| `GET /actuator/info` | Application info |
| `GET /actuator/metrics` | JVM and application metrics |
