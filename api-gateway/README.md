## Overview

`api-gateway` is a **Spring Cloud Gateway** service built on a reactive Netty server. It sits in front of all backend microservices and is the only component directly reachable by external clients. It resolves downstream service addresses dynamically via Eureka and fetches its route configuration from the config-server at startup.

```

**Startup order** — the discovery-service and config-server must be running before the api-gateway starts, since the gateway registers with Eureka and fetches its routes from the config-server.

## Routing

Routes are defined in `config-server/src/main/resources/config/api-gateway.yml` and loaded at startup.

| Route ID | URI | Predicate | Description |
|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `event-service` | `lb://event-service` | `Path=/api/v1/events/**` | Forwards all event API requests to the event-service, resolved via Eureka load balancer |

---

## Filters

### Global — `CorrelationIdFilter`

Applied to every request before it reaches any route filter or downstream service.

- Reads the `X-Correlation-Id` header from the incoming request.
- If absent or blank, generates a new UUID and injects it.
- Propagates the header downstream in the forwarded request.
- Adds the same header to the outgoing response so the client can trace the request end-to-end.
- Logs `[correlationId] METHOD /path` for every request.

### Per-route — CircuitBreaker

Wraps the `event-service` route with a Resilience4j circuit breaker named `eventServiceCB`.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sliding window size | 10 calls |
| Failure rate threshold | 50% |
| Wait duration in open state | 10 s |
| Calls permitted in half-open state | 3 |
| Auto transition to half-open | enabled |

When the circuit is open, requests are forwarded to `/fallback/events` instead of the downstream service.

### Per-route — Retry

Automatically retries failed `GET` requests to the `event-service`.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Retries | 3 |
| Retried statuses | `BAD_GATEWAY`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Methods | `GET` only |
| First backoff | 100 ms |
| Max backoff | 500 ms |
| Backoff factor | 2× |

### Global — CORS

A global CORS policy is applied to all routes:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Allowed origins | `*` |
| Allowed methods | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS` |
| Allowed headers | `*` |

---

## Fallback

When the circuit breaker for the `event-service` is open, the gateway forwards the request to the internal `FallbackController`, which returns a structured `503 Service Unavailable` response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-11T10:00:00",
  "status":    503,
  "error":     "Service Unavailable",
  "message":   "The event service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.",
  "path":      "/fallback/events"
}
```

---

## Configuration

The gateway's main `application.yml` only declares the application name and the optional config-server import. All routing, resilience, CORS, and Actuator settings are served by the config-server:

```yaml
# src/main/resources/application.yml
spring:
  application:
    name: api-gateway
  config:
    import: "optional:configserver:http://localhost:8088"
```

Key properties served by the config-server (`api-gateway.yml`):

```yaml

  port: 8080

  cloud:
    gateway:
      globalcors:
        corsConfigurations:

            allowedMethods: [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS]
            allowedHeaders: "*"

          routes:

              filters:
                - name: CircuitBreaker
                  args:
                    name: eventServiceCB
                    fallbackUri: forward:/fallback/events
                - name: Retry
                  args:
                    retries: 3

## Running the Service

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.9+
- `discovery-service` running at `localhost:8761`
- `config-server` running at `localhost:8088`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the service directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd api-gateway
   ```

2. **Start the required services first** (in order):

   ```bash
   # 1. Discovery service
   cd discovery-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run

   # 2. Config server
   cd config-server && ./mvnw spring-boot:run

   # 3. API Gateway
   cd api-gateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Verify the gateway is running:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
   ```

> The config-server import is declared as `optional:`, so the gateway will still start if the config-server is unavailable — but it will have no routes configured until restarted with the config-server available.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

The test profile uses a dedicated `src/test/resources/application.yml` that disables the config-server import and the Eureka client, so the context loads without requiring any external services.

---

## Health & Monitoring

Spring Boot Actuator exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /actuator/health` | Service health status and circuit breaker state |
| `GET /actuator/info` | Application info |
| `GET /actuator/metrics` | JVM and application metrics |
| `GET /actuator/gateway/routes` | List of all configured routes |
