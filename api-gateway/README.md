# API Gateway - TicketFlow Microservices Project

## Overview
This project is part of the **Spring Boot TicketFlow API**, an incremental microservices system for ticket booking. The API Gateway acts as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services and handling cross-cutting concerns such as security, logging, and resilience.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.x / 4.x**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka (Service Discovery)**
- **Spring Cloud Config (Centralized Configuration)**
- **Maven**
- **Netty (Reactive HTTP Server)**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)

## Architecture
The project follows **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) and **Vertical Slicing** principles. It is composed of several microservices:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all external requests. Handles routing, load balancing, security, and resilience.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for all services.
- **Discovery Service (Eureka Server)**: Service registry for dynamic discovery of microservices.
- **Event Service**: Manages event catalog and ticketing logic.

All services communicate over HTTP using REST APIs. Service discovery and configuration are managed centrally.

## Service Responsibilities
- **API Gateway**: 
  - Routes incoming requests to backend services.
  - Provides a single endpoint for clients.
  - Handles authentication, authorization, and request filtering.
  - Implements resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retries).
- **Config Server**: 
  - Stores and serves configuration properties for all microservices.
  - Enables dynamic configuration updates without redeploying services.
- **Discovery Service**: 
  - Registers all running microservices.
  - Enables dynamic service lookup and load balancing.
- **Event Service**: 
  - Manages events, tickets, and related business logic.
  - Exposes REST endpoints for event catalog operations.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Spring_Boot_TicketFlow_API
   ```
2. **Start the Config Server:**
   ```sh
   cd config-server
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
3. **Start the Discovery Service:**
   ```sh
   cd discovery-service
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
4. **Start the Event Service:**
   ```sh
   cd event-service
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
5. **Start the API Gateway:**
   ```sh
   cd api-gateway
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

> **Note:** Ensure that ports used by each service (default: 8888 for config, 8761 for discovery, 8080/8081/8082 for services) are available.
